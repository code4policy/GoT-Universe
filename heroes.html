	<p>Game of Thrones features rival houses, or factions, across the land of Westeros. Each has a long history dating back generations, but in the world of George R. R. Martin, death can come quickly and entire houses can be wiped away from history. There are currently 8 great houses, 2 former great houses, and 11 that have become extinct. Major relevant houses are listed below.
